# Fraud Detection with Machine Learning (Clustering)

This project uses unsupervised learning techniques to detect suspicious or anomalous behavior.

### 🔧 Techniques Used
- Clustering with **K-Means**
- Density-based clustering with **DBSCAN**
- Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) for visualization
- Comparison of algorithms and interpretation of clusters

### 📂 Contents
- Python notebooks for preprocessing and modeling
- Visualizations of clusters and anomalies
- Summary of business insights for fraud risk

More files will be uploaded soon.
